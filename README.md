# Spring-boot Application

## Description

**⚠️ This app is currently in development and is not yet ready for production use.**

A full-stack web application using Spring Boot for the backend and React for the frontend, designed to enable seamless real-time chat and video communication. I integrated WebSockets for smooth, real-time messaging and used WebRTC to provide voice and video calling capabilities. For secure user authentication, I implemented JWT, ensuring safe logins and session management. The project focuses on offering an engaging, interactive experience with a user-friendly interface and a reliable backend.
